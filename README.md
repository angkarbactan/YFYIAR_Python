# YFYIAR (Python Recreation)
**You Find Yourself In a Room (YFYIAR)** is an escape-themed text-based flash game created by Eli Piilonen. As the name suggests, the player begin their adventure by finding themselves in a room. The player's task is to LOOK AROUND in order to get a description of the environment and try to escape by solving each room's puzzles.

### What is the purpose of this project?
During my bachelor's degree, one of the first school projects that we were assigned to do was to create a game using the C Programming Language. I chose to recreate the flash game as my submission. Unfortunately, when I was finishing up my master's degree, I was caught in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to prevent the spread of this deadly coronavirus, countries went into lockdown and advised their people to stay at home. In order to pass the time, I decided that I was going to learn the Python Programming Language to further bolster my skill set. I found it fitting that the first Python project that I did was based on the first programming project that I did to kick start my IT career.

### Why YFYIAR?
I found that recreating the YFYIAR flash game tests out your learnings since the game is based on the application of the foundations of programming such as:
- Variables
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Functions
- Lists
- String Methods
- Random Number Generation

**NOTE: This project may not be a perfect recreation of the flash game. I am basing the code of this project from the C program that I have submitted during my bachelor's degree.
